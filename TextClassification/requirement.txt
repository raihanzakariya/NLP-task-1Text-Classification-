Write a Python program that:

Loads the Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.
Selects only two classes: Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica for a binary classification task.
Builds a Logistic Regression model to predict the flower type.
Evaluates the model with accuracy and confusion matrix.
SQL - Employee Hierarchy Query (5 Marks)

Problem:
You are given a table named employees with the following schema:



employees (
  emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  emp_name VARCHAR(100),
  manager_id INT
);



Write an SQL query to retrieve the number of direct and indirect subordinates for each employee.

Note: An indirect subordinate is someone down the hierarchy, not directly managed by the given employee.
